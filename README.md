## Overview:

The Weather App is a single-page application built using React that provides users with real-time weather information for their current location and allows them to search for weather data in other locations. The app offers a user-friendly interface with features such as current weather conditions, a 5-day forecast, weather alerts for severe conditions, and customizable settings. The project was created to demonstrate how to build a weather app using React, React Router, and integrating with a weather API to fetch accurate weather data.

## Features:

- **5-Day Forecast:** Plan ahead with a 5-day weather forecast displaying temperature highs and lows for each day.
- **Weather Alerts:** Stay informed about severe weather conditions with real-time weather alerts.
- **Customization Options:** Customize the app's appearance with settings to choose between light and dark modes and switch between temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit).
- **Search for Locations:** Search for weather data in any location by using the search bar to enter the location name.
